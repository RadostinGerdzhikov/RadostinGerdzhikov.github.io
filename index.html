                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has
                        become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest
                        of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top
                        fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in
                        2017.<br>Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great
                        potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking,
                        insurance, auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she
                        has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how
                        robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her
                        reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first
                        United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an
                        official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights
                        and equality.<br>
                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and
                        remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology
                        story.<br>
                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day
                        renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act
                        amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius
                        machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively
                        human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines:
                        Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’
                        genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves.
                        Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.<br>
                        Please follow Sophia’s journey to observe and engage with her as she develops into an exciting
                        platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and service robotics applications in
                        business, medical/healthcare, and education.<br>

                        <h2>Dinosaurs built different types of nests for their eggs</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        Tens of millions of years ago, dinosaurs liked to build nests to keep their eggs warm, just like reptiles and birds today. Now we know a little bit more about how and where the nests were built. <br>A new study released Thursday says that dinosaurs’ use of specific materials and techniques in nest building — which influenced how warm their eggs would be — may have affected where they were able to live.

                        By building nests to keep their eggs warm enough, “dinosaurs successfully incubated their eggs in various climates, presumably using brooding behaviors or various styles of nests like living birds today,” the study said.

                        The study was published in Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed British journal. <br>
                        However, others preferred mounds made of soil and plants that were heated by microbes as they decayed organic matter, making them significantly warmer than the surrounding air. This allowed the dinosaurs that built them to reproduce in colder, more northerly climates, such as the Arctic.

                        In order to better understand dinosaur nesting habits, paleontologists looked at the nesting strategies of living animals today — such as crocodiles and birds — to assess whether certain types of nests could have been used by dinosaurs in cooler climates.

                        The authors also compared data on dinosaur nests, eggs and eggshells to find out whether dinosaurs preferred certain materials to build covered nests. The comparisons show that the relationship between nest types, building materials, and heat sources for incubation as seen in animals today could give clues about nesting habits in extinct, non-birdlike dinosaurs.<br>
                        Thus, the study concludes that the dinosaurs’ preferred nesting style may have played a role in where they were able to live.
